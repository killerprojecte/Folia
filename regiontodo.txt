Get done before testing:
- Entity tracking: Dear god what the fuck to do here
  -> move state to tracker field, so no extra region data required -- DONE
  -> modify tick function to only tick entities in region -- DONE
- Check ServerChunkCache#tick
- MapItemSavedData, good grief
- Unfuck mob spawning
  -> ChunkMap#getPlayersCloseForSpawning
  -> DistanceManager getNaturalSpawnChunkCount & hasPlayersNearby
  -> PlayerMap in ChunkMap#playerMap
  -> Check how per player config factors in
  -> mob cap command
- Global tick stuff (weather etc)
- Shutdown/startup process (both the regular and irregular variants)
- Make sure structurecheck class is thread-safe, and that structure referencing from the structure search
- make sure async teleport / player join / async place entities are saved on shutdown
- make scheduler load chunks better
- DamageSource.FLY_INTO_WALL from flying into unloaded chunks

Pre-Test: List of things not fully tested
- Task queue
- Teleportations
- Regioniser

Get done after test:
- global autosave queue
- game time / day time tick comparison (== is now invalid due to desync of global / region tick)
- scoreboards
- vanish api
- watchdog stuff
- Spectator teleporting / camera
- automatically disable timings
- regenerateChunk, isChunkGenerated
- Conversable...
- sync load info
- net.minecraft.commands.Commands 
- are the race conditions in the weather tick (advanceWeatherCycle) ok?

Delayed and hopefully will not forget:
- api for really a lot of shit
  - needs: true async events (i.e fire then complete later)
  - needs: region determination, craft scheduler per region, craft scheduler
           per entity
  - needs: world creation/unload (good god)
  - needs: more???
- Projectile#getOwner ...
  
Ideas:

Issues:
- Region chunk loader may not handle low config values well (i.e max chunk gens -> 5)

To check:
- Ensure dead players are truly in the world, and that their region is loaded
