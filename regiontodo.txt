Get done before testing:
- make scheduler load chunks better

Pre-Test: List of things not fully tested
- Task queue
- Teleportations
- Regioniser

Get done after test:
- global autosave queue
- game time / day time tick comparison (== is now invalid due to desync of global / region tick)
- scoreboards
- vanish api
- watchdog stuff
- Spectator teleporting / camera
- regenerateChunk, isChunkGenerated
- Conversable...
- sync load info
- net.minecraft.commands.Commands 
- are the race conditions in the weather tick (advanceWeatherCycle) ok?

Delayed and hopefully will not forget:
- api for really a lot of shit
  - needs: true async events (i.e fire then complete later)
  - needs: region determination, craft scheduler per region, craft scheduler
           per entity
  - needs: world creation/unload (good god)
  - needs: more???
- Projectile#getOwner ...
